      # It contains zero or more YAML documents; each document is one Solaar rule.

      # Rules trigger from HID++ notifications, so buttons usually must first be set
      # to a diverted action in Solaar's Key/Button Diversion setting. Under Wayland,
      # actions that synthesize input use /dev/uinput; the system Logitech module
      # installs Solaar's udev rules through hardware.logitech.wireless.enable.

      # MX Master 4 notes:
      # - Button/key labels are reported by device firmware and Solaar. Verify exact
      #   names with `solaar show` and the Solaar Key/Button Diversion UI.
      # - Common MX Master-family labels include Back Button, Forward Button,
      #   Smart Shift, and Gesture Button, but the MX Master 4 may expose different
      #   labels depending on firmware and connection type.
      # - Useful feature names/tests documented by Solaar include THUMB WHEEL with
      #   thumb_wheel_up/thumb_wheel_down, LOWRES WHEEL with lowres_wheel_up/
      #   lowres_wheel_down, and HIRES WHEEL with hires_wheel_up/hires_wheel_down.
      # - MX Master 4-specific settings in current Solaar include scroll-ratchet,
      #   thumb button click force, haptic force, and haptic-play.
      #
      # Example: map a diverted button press to a key press after verifying the label.
