# OpenCode Agent Instructions

## Branch Naming

- Before pushing or creating a PR/MR, check if the current branch uses OpenCode's default auto-generated name (e.g., `opencode/playful-engine`).
- If it does, **rename the current branch in place** with `git branch -m` — do **NOT** create a new branch and reset/cherry-pick onto it.
  - Renaming preserves the full working tree, index, commit history, and uncommitted changes atomically.
  - Creating a sibling branch leaves an abandoned `opencode/*` branch behind, splits your work across two refs, and risks losing track of which branch has the latest state.
- **Rule of thumb**: one task = one branch. If the branch name needs to change, rename it — never create a parallel branch for the same work.
- Unless the project specifies its own branch naming convention, follow **Git Flow** branch naming: `<type>/<short-description>` (e.g., `feature/add-auth-flow`, `bugfix/login-redirect`, `hotfix/critical-crash`).
  - `feature/` — New features or enhancements
  - `bugfix/` — Bug fixes
  - `hotfix/` — Urgent production fixes
  - `release/` — Release preparation
  - `refactor/` — Code restructuring
  - `docs/` — Documentation changes
  - `chore/` — Maintenance and config changes
- When a rename is needed, **load the `git-flow-branch-creator` skill** to analyze the current diff and generate the correct Git Flow branch name.

```bash
# Check current branch
git branch --show-current

# ✅ CORRECT: rename in place (preserves all state)
git branch -m opencode/playful-engine feature/add-auth-flow

# ❌ WRONG: do NOT create a new branch alongside the opencode/* one
git checkout -b feature/add-auth-flow   # leaves opencode/playful-engine orphaned
```

## Commit Messages

- Follow the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** specification for all commit messages.
- Format: `<type>(<optional scope>): <description>`
  - `feat` — New feature
  - `fix` — Bug fix
  - `docs` — Documentation only
  - `style` — Formatting, whitespace (no logic change)
  - `refactor` — Code restructuring (no feature/fix)
  - `perf` — Performance improvement
  - `test` — Adding or updating tests
  - `build` — Build system or dependencies
  - `ci` — CI/CD configuration
  - `chore` — Maintenance tasks
  - `revert` — Reverting a previous commit
- **Subject line**: lowercase, imperative mood, no period, max 72 characters.
- **Scope** (optional): module or area affected (e.g., `feat(auth): add JWT refresh`).
- **Body** (optional): explain *why*, not *what*. Wrap at 72 characters.
- **Breaking changes**: add `!` after type/scope and include a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer (e.g., `feat(api)!: remove v1 endpoints`).

```
feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation
fix(ui): prevent double-submit on checkout button
docs: update deployment instructions for Workers
refactor(db): extract query builders into shared module
chore: bump dependencies
feat(api)!: remove deprecated v1 endpoints

BREAKING CHANGE: v1 API endpoints have been removed. Migrate to v2.
```

## Pull Requests / Merge Requests

- **Before creating a PR/MR, ensure all changes are committed and pushed** to the remote repository:
  ```bash
  # Check for uncommitted changes
  git status
  
  # Commit any pending changes
  git add <files>
  git commit -m "type(scope): description"
  
  # Push to remote
  git push -u origin <branch-name>
  ```
- When creating a pull request or merge request, **always set the assignee to the authenticated user**.
  - GitHub: `gh pr create --assignee @me`
  - GitLab: `glab mr create --assignee $(glab api user | jq -r '.username')`
- GitLab MRs should **always include `--remove-source-branch`** to clean up after merge.
- When the MR originates from a GitLab issue, use `--related-issue <issue-number>` to link them.

### GitLab MR Example

```bash
glab mr create \
  --assignee "$(glab api user | jq -r '.username')" \
  --remove-source-branch \
  --related-issue 42 \
  --title "Fix login redirect loop" \
  --description "Resolves #42"
```

## Figma

- When given a Figma link, **always use the `figma` MCP** to retrieve design information. Never access Figma URLs directly (e.g., via web fetch or browser automation).
- If the `figma` MCP is unavailable or returns an error, **ask the user to fix the MCP configuration** instead of attempting alternative access methods.

## Interactive / Long-Running Processes

- When launching interactive or long-running processes (e.g., dev servers, watch modes, TUI apps), **always use the `tmux` tool** (`mcp_interactive_bash`) instead of regular shell execution.
- This prevents blocking the agent session and allows the process to run in the background while continuing other work.

## Rebase

- When rebasing a feature branch onto the default branch (e.g., `main`), **prefer changes from the default branch** when resolving conflicts.
- Treat the current working branch as changes that will be merged *into* the default branch, not the other way around.
- If a conflict arises during rebase, prefer the version from `main` (the target) over your branch's version (the source being rebased).

## Scripting Runtime

- **Never use Python** for scripting, tooling, or any code generation tasks.
- Use **Node.js**, **Deno**, or **Bun** instead.
- When a task requires a script (e.g., data transformation, automation, CLI tools), default to TypeScript/JavaScript running on one of the above runtimes.
