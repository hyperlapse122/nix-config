# ThinkPad efivarfs immutable attribute blocks sbctl key enrollment

## Problem

When enrolling custom Secure Boot keys using `sudo sbctl enroll-keys --microsoft` on ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 (with UEFI in Setup Mode), `sbctl` fails with an error stating that the target EFI variable file is immutable (`File is immutable`).

## Symptoms

- Firmware is properly switched to Setup Mode in UEFI BIOS.
- `sbctl status` reports Setup Mode enabled.
- Running `sudo sbctl enroll-keys --microsoft` fails when writing `KEK` or `db` variables with:
  ```
  Failed to enroll keys: ...: File is immutable
  ```

## Root Cause

The Linux `efivarfs` kernel filesystem sets the immutable ext2/ext4 attribute bit (`+i`) on critical UEFI variables (such as `PK`, `KEK`, `db`, and `dbx`) to prevent accidental deletion or modification by userspace tools. Even in root execution context and with UEFI firmware in Setup Mode, write syscalls fail if the Linux filesystem-level immutable flag is active on the pseudo-files under `/sys/firmware/efi/efivars/`.

## Solution

1. Install `e2fsprogs` in system packages (`modules/nixos/base.nix`) so `chattr` and `lsattr` are available on the installed system:
   ```nix
   environment.systemPackages = [ pkgs.e2fsprogs ... ];
   ```

2. Clear the immutable attribute on the EFI variable files prior to running `sbctl enroll-keys`:
   ```sh
   sudo chattr -i /sys/firmware/efi/efivars/{PK,KEK,db}* 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

3. Re-run `sbctl enroll-keys --microsoft`. The keys will be written successfully to the UEFI NVRAM.

## Why this works

`chattr -i` issues the `FS_IOC_SETFLAGS` ioctl to remove the `FS_IMMUTABLE_FL` attribute on the pseudo-file in `efivarfs`. Once cleared, userspace tools (such as `sbctl`) can open the variable with `O_WRONLY`/`O_RDWR` and write the enrolled certificate payloads.

## Prevention

The installation documentation in `docs/install.md` includes the `chattr -i` invocation immediately before `sbctl enroll-keys`.
