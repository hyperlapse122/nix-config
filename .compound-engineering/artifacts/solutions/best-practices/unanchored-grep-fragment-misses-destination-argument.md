# An unanchored grep fragment misses the argument that decides where a write lands

## Context

`tests/logind-lid-switch.nix` guards the KDE Powerdevil lid-action configuration `home/h82/kde/power-lid.nix` writes via eight `kwriteconfig6 --file powerdevilrc --group <profile> --group SuspendAndShutdown --key <key> ...` invocations. Its `assertPowerdevilHandled` helper reads the materialized `home.activation.kdePowerLid` script and asserts each invocation's shape is present, using `grep -Fq` (substring match) against fragments such as `--group Battery --group SuspendAndShutdown --key LidAction -- 1`.

This repository already carries six learnings about checks that pass without proving what they claim. None of them predicted this one: the assertion here is sound by every test those six apply. The shell can fail (`if ! grep ...; then exit 1; fi`, never a bare `! grep` under `set -e`). The value read is materialized output — the rendered activation script — not an unreachable option. The fixture states genuinely diverge across the three `assertHost`-style calls (ThinkPad production, ThinkPad bootstrap, MS-7D91). No operand folds to a constant the module under test cannot change. No shell comparison sees an empty numeric operand. All five checks pass, and the check still could not tell a correct write from one aimed at the wrong file.

## The practice

**When an assertion's expected substring is a fragment of a multi-argument invocation, include the argument that picks the destination, not only the arguments that describe the value.** `kwriteconfig6 --file powerdevilrc --group Battery --group SuspendAndShutdown --key LidAction -- 1` bundles two roles into one line: `--file powerdevilrc` says *where* the write goes, and the rest says *what* it writes. A fragment built only from the second half is blind to the first — it matches identically whether the real invocation targeted `powerdevilrc` or an unrelated file, because `grep -Fq` (and even an anchored `grep -Fxq`, since these are fragments rather than whole lines) has no way to know the destination was ever part of the claim.

```nix
# before: matches regardless of --file
"--group Battery --group SuspendAndShutdown --key LidAction -- 1"

# after: the destination is part of what must match
"--file powerdevilrc --group Battery --group SuspendAndShutdown --key LidAction -- 1"
```

## What was verified

Two rounds, each `nix build --no-link .#checks.x86_64-linux.logind-lid-switch`:

| Round | Mutation | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (before the fix) | `--file powerdevilrc` -> `--file WRONGFILE.rc` on the Battery `LidAction` write only | green — the fragment still matched somewhere in the script |
| 2 (after the fix, same mutation) | identical mutation, expected fragments now include `--file powerdevilrc` | red: `ThinkPad-X1-Carbon-Gen-11: kdePowerLid activation script is missing: --file powerdevilrc --group Battery --group SuspendAndShutdown --key LidAction -- 1` |

The pairing is the point: the same tree, the same mutation, goes from a false pass to a correct failure purely by adding the discriminating argument to the expected string.

## How to apply

- When a check's expected value is a fragment of a longer shell invocation — not a whole line, not a whole file — ask which argument in the real invocation actually decides the outcome the check claims to guard, and confirm that argument is inside the fragment, not merely adjacent to it in the source.
- This generalizes past `--file`: any invocation with a destination or selector argument separate from its value arguments (an `--output`, a `--target`, a `--namespace`, a table or key name passed alongside a value) can be matched by a fragment that omits the selector, and the check will pass on a write aimed at the wrong destination.
- Mutating only the value (the class the existing six learnings already cover) is not sufficient coverage for this class of check. Add a destination mutation as its own round: change what the invocation targets, keep the value the same, and confirm the check still catches it.
- A sound assertion, materialized-output evidence, a diverged fixture, no constant operand, and no empty-operand comparison are five different questions. This is a sixth: once you assemble the real invocation from the source that produces it, does the matched fragment carry every argument the invocation needed to reach the outcome being asserted?

## Out of scope

Whether Powerdevil's own runtime actually applies a written `powerdevilrc` value (live-reload versus needing a relogin) is not a build-time question; it is a hardware-verification item in `docs/verification.md`. This check proves the activation script writes the right value to the right file, nothing about the running KDE session's response to it.
