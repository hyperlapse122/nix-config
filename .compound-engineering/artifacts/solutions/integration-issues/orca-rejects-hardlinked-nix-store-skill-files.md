# Orca rejects skill files hardlinked by the Nix store optimiser

## Problem

Orca's agent skills were installed with Home Manager `home.file` links into the pinned `stablyai/orca` source in the Nix store. Orca never recognized them as its own skills. The user saw this as a version mismatch between the installed skills and Orca.

## Symptoms

- Orca reported the installed Orca skills as not matching the installed Orca version.
- The version pin was already correct. `packages/orca.nix` fetches the AppImage and the skills source from the same `v${version}` tag (1.4.206 at the time).
- The content was also correct. Every `SKILL.md` hashed identically to its entry in the AppImage's `resources/skills/current-manifest.json`.

## What didn't work

Comparing git references and file contents could not find the fault, because both already matched. Pointing the two fetches at "the same reference" would have changed nothing. The files Orca reads were byte-identical to the release. The difference was in their filesystem metadata.

## Solution

Orca 1.4.206 judges an installed skill by walking the skill directory itself. Its observer in the AppImage's `resources/app.asar` throws when a regular file's link count is not 1:

```js
else if(y.isFile()){if(y.nlink!==1)throw Error(`skill-package-link`); ...
```

The caller catches that error and reports the skill as `unrecognized`, with `installedAppVersion: null`. It never reaches the digest comparison that would have matched.

This host sets `auto-optimise-store = true`, so the store hardlinks identical files. The skills' `SKILL.md` files in `/nix/store/...-orca-skills-1.4.206/skills/*/` had link counts of 3 to 6. A Home Manager link resolves to those files, so every skill failed the check.

The fix installs plain per-user copies instead of links. `home/h82/agents/orca-skills.nix` defines an `orca-skills-install` script and runs it from `home.activation.orcaSkills`, ordered after `linkGeneration`. For each root (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.gemini/config/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`), the script does the following:

- Copies each skill into a staging directory, makes it user-writable, and moves it into place over the old one.
- Writes a `.orca-skills` manifest of the names it installed. The next run removes a name that left the source and leaves a user's own skills alone.

After the fix, the source files still show a link count of 3 and every copy shows 1.

## Why This Works

A copy in `$HOME` is a new inode with a link count of 1. A second store derivation that copies the tree would not help. The optimiser can hardlink any identical file inside the store, so only files outside the store are guaranteed a link count of 1. That also rules out a Home Manager `home.file` entry of any kind, because Home Manager always links into the store.

## Prevention

- Do not install anything into the store for a tool that inspects the files themselves, as opposed to reading their content. Check the tool for `lstat`/`nlink` tests, symlink rejection, or ownership checks before choosing `home.file`.
- `tests/orca-skills.nix` runs the materialized activation script twice against a fixture home. It asserts that each copied file has a link count of 1, that no skill is a symlink, and that the copy matches the pinned source. It also checks pruning and that a user's own skill survives. Mutation rounds confirmed that a store link, a hardlinked copy, a missing prune, and a merge-instead-of-replace each turn the check red.
- The builder bash in `pkgs.runCommand` does not include `compgen`. An assertion written as `if compgen -G ...; then fail; fi` hits "command not found", which returns nonzero, so the branch never runs and the check stays green. Use `find` for glob-existence tests in checks, and mutation-test any new assertion as `AGENTS.md` requires.
- The copies change only when a new Home Manager generation activates, not on every `nixos-rebuild switch`. See [activation does not re-run when the generation is unchanged](../best-practices/home-manager-activation-does-not-run-on-every-rebuild.md).
