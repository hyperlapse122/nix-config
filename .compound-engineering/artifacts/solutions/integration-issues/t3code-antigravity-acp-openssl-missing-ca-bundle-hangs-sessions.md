# T3 Code's Antigravity ACP server finds no CA bundle on NixOS and hangs every session silently

## Problem

T3 Code runs its Antigravity provider through an ACP server it downloads itself, `~/.t3/tools/antigravity-acp/linux-x64/versions/<hash>/agy_acp_server.par`. That binary embeds a Python with its own OpenSSL, and the OpenSSL's compiled-in default CA path, `/opt/pyca/cryptography/openssl/cert.pem`, does not exist on NixOS. Every model request fails certificate verification. The server keeps retrying and never reports the failure to T3, so every Antigravity session hangs with no output.

## Symptoms

- An Antigravity thread in T3, or an Antigravity task started with `delegate_task`, never answers, not even "hi".
- T3's per-thread provider event log (`~/.t3/userdata/logs/provider/events.<thread>.log`) records `initialize`, `authenticate`, `session/new`, and `session/set_config_option` as succeeded and `session/prompt` as started, then no `session/update` at all.
- The thread has no pending approval request, and Full access hangs exactly like Supervised.
- The real error appears only in the server's own glog files, under `~/.t3/userdata/antigravity-tmp/<id>/run-*/agy_acp_server.par.{INFO,ERROR}`: `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED ... unable to get local issuer certificate`, raised from `ccpa_client.stream_generate_content` and logged by `proxy_server.py` as "Proxy failed to connect to CCPA API".

## What Didn't Work

- **Blaming the runtime mode.** The first run used Supervised (`approval-required`), and the hang looked like an approval waiting where nobody could see it. Re-running with Full access hung identically, and the thread's `pendingRequestCount` was 0 throughout.
- **Blaming Google authentication.** A Google sign-in prompt appeared during debugging and was completed. Sessions still hung afterwards, because `authenticate` had been succeeding all along and the failure came later, at the model call.
- **Comparing with the `agy` CLI.** `agy` answered "hi" and listed its conversations, but none from T3. It is a different binary with a different state directory (`~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/`), while T3 points the ACP server at its own `GEMINI_HOME` under `~/.t3/userdata/providers/antigravity/<hash>`. A working `agy` says nothing about T3's server.
- **Attaching `strace` to the hung server.** `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1` refuses attaching to a process that is not your child, so the CA paths the server tries could not be traced live. Finding the server's open log file descriptors under `/proc/<pid>/fd` led to the glog files instead.
- **Checking the CA bundle itself.** `openssl s_client` verified the Google endpoint against both `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` and the `cacerts` file the server extracts next to its logs. The bundle was fine; the server simply never loaded it. Grepping the `.par` for CA paths found `/opt/pyca/cryptography/openssl/cert.pem` alongside `SSL_CERT_FILE`.

## Solution

Point `SSL_CERT_FILE` at the system bundle inside the T3 Code desktop wrapper's bubblewrap sandbox, which every provider process T3 starts inherits (`packages/t3code.nix:43`):

```nix
extraBwrapArgs = [
  "--setenv T3CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE 1"
  ''--setenv CONTAINER_HOST "unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock"''
  "--setenv SSL_CERT_FILE /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
];
```

Inside the sandbox, `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` is the host's `/etc/static` symlink (observed through `/proc/<server-pid>/root` in this session), so the server reads the same bundle NixOS builds from `security.pki`. The `t3code` check in `flake.nix:1158` asserts the wrapper sets it. The change takes effect after a rebuild and a T3 Code restart, because providers inherit the environment of the running app.

## Why This Works

OpenSSL reads `SSL_CERT_FILE` before falling back to its compiled-in default, so the embedded Python's `ssl.create_default_context()` loads the system bundle instead of the missing `/opt/pyca/...` file. A standalone ACP client run against the same server binary with T3's `GEMINI_HOME` proved it: with `SSL_CERT_FILE` set, `session/prompt` streamed "Hello! How can I help you today?" within five seconds; without it, the same prompt produced nothing for 40 seconds. After the rebuild and restart, a delegated Antigravity task completed through T3.

## Prevention

- **When an ACP provider in T3 hangs after `session/prompt`, read the provider's own logs first.** T3's event log only shows that no `session/update` arrived. For Antigravity, the cause is in `~/.t3/userdata/antigravity-tmp/<id>/run-*/agy_acp_server.par.ERROR`. In this session the run directories were gone once the server processes exited, so read them while the hung session is still alive.
- **Reproduce outside T3 with a minimal ACP client** that spawns the server with T3's environment (`GEMINI_HOME`, `ANTIGRAVITY_HARNESS_PATH`, `AGY_ACP_FORCE_FILE_STORAGE`, all readable from `/proc/<pid>/environ`) and sends `initialize`, `authenticate`, `session/new`, and `session/prompt` over stdio. Toggling one variable between runs turns a guess into a proof.
- **Expect vendored binaries that bundle OpenSSL to miss NixOS's CA paths.** Check a new downloaded tool's outbound TLS once, and set `SSL_CERT_FILE` in its wrapper when its default path does not exist here.
- **Cancelling a delegated Antigravity task leaves its server running.** In T3 Code 0.0.46-nightly, `task_cancel` stopped the task, but its `agy_acp_server.par` and `localharness_external` processes stayed alive until killed by hand. Check for them before reusing a debugging session.
