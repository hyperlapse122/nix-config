# Rootless Podman pause process started inside the Orca sandbox poisons the host Podman service

## Problem

Orca IDE ships as a bubblewrap FHS sandbox, and its agent terminals inherit that sandbox. When a local rootless `podman` or `docker` command runs there first, it creates the per-user pause process inside the sandbox. After that, the host's `podman.service` joins that pause process's namespaces and can no longer see the host's `/etc/containers` or `/etc/subuid` (issue #121).

## Symptoms

- Testcontainers' `POST /images/create` returned HTTP 500. `journalctl --user -u podman.service` logged `no policy.json file found at any of the following: /home/h82/.config/containers/policy.json, /etc/containers/policy.json`.
- After the user created `~/.config/containers/policy.json` by hand, `podman pull docker.io/library/postgres:17-alpine` failed with `potentially insufficient UIDs or GIDs available in user namespace (requested 0:42 for /etc/shadow): Check /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid ... lchown /etc/shadow: invalid argument`.
- `podman info` warned `cannot find UID/GID for user h82: open /etc/subuid`.
- The failure was in the host's user service, not in the sandbox, so it also hit clients that talk to the socket from outside Orca.

## What Didn't Work

- **The fix proposed in the issue.** Issue #121 suggested enabling `virtualisation.containers` and `autoSubUidGidRange`. Both were already in effect: `modules/nixos/services/podman.nix:15-18` enables `virtualisation.podman` (which pulls in the containers configuration), and `modules/nixos/services/podman.nix:27` sets `users.users.h82.autoSubUidGidRange = true`. On the real host, `/etc/containers/policy.json` existed and `/etc/subuid` contained `h82:100000:65536`.
- **Checking `/etc` from an Orca terminal.** `ls /etc/containers` in an Orca terminal fails, which looks like it confirms the issue. The files only seem missing because that shell runs inside the sandbox. A host-side check shows them:

  ```sh
  systemd-run --user --wait --pipe --quiet /run/current-system/sw/bin/sh -c 'ls /etc/containers'
  ```

  A bare `sh` in `systemd-run` fails with status `203/EXEC`, because the transient unit has no `PATH`. Use the absolute path.
- **Hand-writing `~/.config/containers/policy.json`.** That got past the first error, but the next one, missing subuid ranges, comes from the same poisoned namespace. A user-level file cannot supply it.

## Solution

### Diagnosis

Inside an Orca terminal:

- `findmnt /etc` shows a `tmpfs` owned by `uid=1000`.
- `/etc/static` is a symlink to `/.host-etc/static`.
- `/proc/self/status` shows `NoNewPrivs: 1`, so the setuid `newuidmap`/`newgidmap` helpers cannot run.
- `/proc/self/uid_map` is `1000 1000 1`.

This matches the nixpkgs bubblewrap FHS builder. It mounts `--tmpfs /etc` (`pkgs/build-support/build-fhsenv-bubblewrap/default.nix:311`), bind-mounts the real host `/etc` at `/.host-etc` (`default.nix:214-218`), and symlinks back only the entries on a fixed allow-list, `etcBindEntries` (`default.nix:87-134`, linked at `default.nix:226-232`). That list includes `static`, `passwd`, `group`, and `shadow`. It does not include `containers`, `subuid`, or `subgid`.

The pause process gave the sandbox away:

- `cat $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/libpod/tmp/pause.pid` pointed to a process whose command was `docker`. It started at 17:48:43, 9 seconds before `podman.service` started at 17:48:52.
- `/proc/<pid>/uid_map` was `0 1000 1`, a single-ID map with no subuid range.
- `/proc/<pid>/root/etc/static` resolved to `/.host-etc/static`, so its root was the sandbox root.
- Its environment carried `ORCA_*` variables.

Rootless Podman keeps one pause process per user to hold the user and mount namespaces. Every later rootless Podman process joins it, including `podman system service` behind `podman.service`. The host service therefore inherited the sandbox's `/etc` and its one-ID user namespace. That accounts for both the missing `policy.json` and the `lchown /etc/shadow` failure: GID 42 (`shadow`) has no mapping.

### Fix

Before, `packages/orca.nix` passed no Podman setting into the sandbox, so `podman` and `docker` (through `dockerCompat`) ran locally inside bubblewrap.

After, `packages/orca.nix:38-40`:

```nix
extraBwrapArgs = [
  ''--setenv CONTAINER_HOST "unix://$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/podman/podman.sock"''
];
```

nixpkgs writes `extraBwrapArgs` unquoted into the bwrap `cmd` array of the generated launcher script (`default.nix:330`). As a result, `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` expands when Orca starts, not at build time. When `CONTAINER_HOST` is set, Podman defaults to `--remote`. Every `podman` and `docker` call inside Orca then goes to the host's rootless socket, the same one Home Manager exports as `DOCKER_HOST = "unix://\${XDG_RUNTIME_DIR}/podman/podman.sock"` (`home/h82/dev/containers.nix:16`), and never creates a pause process inside the sandbox. The comment above the option (`packages/orca.nix:33-37`) records why. The change is on the issue #121 branch, and its PR is pending as of this writing.

### Clearing already-poisoned state

The wrapper change does not fix a pause process that already exists. From a **host** terminal, not an Orca one:

```sh
podman system migrate   # or: kill "$(cat "$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/libpod/tmp/pause.pid")"
```

Then restart Orca so it runs the new wrapper.

### Verification (this session)

After the stale pause process was killed, with `CONTAINER_HOST` exported by hand in an existing Orca terminal to stand in for the new wrapper (Orca itself was not restarted):

- `podman info` inside the Orca terminal reported `ServiceIsRemote: true`.
- The host's UIDMap was `[{0 1000 1} {1 100000 65536}]`.
- `podman pull alpine:3.20` succeeded.
- `docker run --rm alpine:3.20 cat /etc/alpine-release` printed `3.20.10`.
- The new pause process was created on the host, not inside the sandbox.

## Why This Works

The fault is not in the host's configuration. It is in which process creates the shared namespace holder first. The sandbox cannot build a correct rootless user namespace: its `/etc` lacks `subuid`/`subgid`, and `no_new_privs` blocks the setuid ID-mapping helpers. Because Podman reuses the pause process, one bad start stays in place for the rest of the user session. Remote mode means Orca never starts a local Podman at all, so the host service's own pause process, created with the host's `/etc` and full subuid range, is the only one.

Trade-off: Podman's local-only subcommands (`podman unshare`, `podman mount`, `podman system migrate`, `podman system reset`) do not work inside Orca terminals. Run them from a host terminal.

## Prevention

- **Repository check.** The `orca-desktop` check in `flake.nix` (`flake.nix:751-780`) reads the materialized `bin/orca-ide` launcher, not the option value. It greps the `--setenv CONTAINER_HOST` line (`flake.nix:768`), `eval`s it under the fake `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/4242` (`flake.nix:752`), and compares the result with Home Manager's `DOCKER_HOST` expanded the same way. It also requires the value to contain the fake runtime directory. A path baked in at build time therefore fails. In this session, changing the argument to a hardcoded `/run/user/1000` turned the check red.
- **General rule.** Any tool that keeps a persistent per-user namespace holder is at risk here: rootless Podman's pause process, and anything else that later processes join. If a sandboxed client starts it first, host-side users of it break later. Before you believe a "file missing" error from such a tool, find the holder's PID and check `/proc/<pid>/root` (for example `/proc/<pid>/root/etc/static`), `/proc/<pid>/uid_map`, and `/proc/<pid>/environ`. Check them before you change host configuration.
- **Checking host files from a sandboxed shell.** Use `systemd-run --user --wait --pipe --quiet /run/current-system/sw/bin/sh -c '...'` to see the host's view.
