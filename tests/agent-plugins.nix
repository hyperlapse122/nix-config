/*
  Check interface:

    import ./tests/agent-plugins.nix { inherit pkgs self; }

  Asserts that the Nix-owned agent plugin layer reaches user `h82` on every
  host this flake declares, and that its pin still names the revision this
  repository expects.

  The configuration list comes from `tests/lib/configurations.nix` rather than
  being written out, so a host added later is covered the day it is added
  instead of silently escaping the assertions, and the helper's guard fails the
  build when that list is empty. Every configuration shares `home/h82`, so the
  layer holds on all of them.

  What this check can and cannot reach:

  - The wiring's command sequence lives in the packaged `agent-plugin-sync`
    helper, not in the activation script, so its order, rollback, readback and
    pruning are proven by the `agent-plugin-sync` check in flake.nix, which
    drives the real script against a fake agent CLI. Asserting the order here
    would only re-read a string this check also builds.
  - What activation *materializes* is this check's job: that the entry exists,
    is ordered so a refusal cannot strand installPackages, hands the helper the
    pinned source rather than some other path, and names the version segment
    the lock actually resolved.

  The pin assertion compares two genuinely separate sources: `flake.lock`,
  which Nix writes, and the registry in home/h82/agents/agent-plugins.nix, which a
  person writes. A tag is mutable and a relock re-resolves the ref, so the tag
  alone is not a pin -- if upstream moves it, the lock's revision changes and
  this assertion goes red instead of the change arriving as a lock diff.
  Seeding both from the lock would compare a value with itself.

  What the segment comparison does and does not catch, established by mutation
  rounds rather than by reading it: changing the registry's `tag` without
  relocking turns it red for its own reason on every configuration, which is
  the drift it exists for. Changing `tagPrefix` leaves it green, because the prefix is
  stripped from both the registry's tag and the lock's ref -- both sides move
  together, so that axis is consistent by construction rather than guarded.
  Do not read the prefix as protected here.

  Every lookup carries an `or` fallback and every conditional block is behind
  `lib.optionalString`, so a mutation that removes a declaration reaches the
  builder as shell rather than failing evaluation on a null interpolation. See
  .compound-engineering/artifacts/solutions/best-practices/unguarded-derivation-interpolation-defeats-nix-check-mutation-testing.md

  The builder collects every failure instead of exiting at the first, so one
  red build names every broken assertion across every configuration.
