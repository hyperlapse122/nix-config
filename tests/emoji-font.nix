  Check interface:

    import ./tests/emoji-font.nix { inherit pkgs self; }

  Asserts that emoji resolve to the color Twemoji font on every configuration
  `tests/lib/configurations.nix` yields, production and bootstrap alike.

  It runs fontconfig against each configuration's built /etc/fonts, not the
  `fonts.fontconfig.defaultFonts` options, so the order nixpkgs merges into
  the generic aliases is what gets tested. fonts.conf includes the absolute
  /etc/fonts/conf.d, which does not exist in the build sandbox, so the check
  loads a copy whose include points at the built conf.d.

  Fallback is modelled the way Skia, Pango, and Qt pick a glyph: the first
  font in `fc-match -s <family>` order whose charset covers the codepoint.
  `fc-match "<family>:charset=..."` scores charset as one weak element and
  returns fonts no app would pick, so it is not used.

  Verifies, per configuration:
  - U+1F600 resolves to Twitter Color Emoji for sans-serif, serif,
    monospace, and emoji.
  - U+1F600 resolves to Twitter Color Emoji for the named families Noto Sans
    and Liberation Sans when the request carries lang=und-zsye. Chromium,
    Pango, and Qt 6.9+ segment emoji-presentation characters and request
    them that way. A plain named-family request still reaches DejaVu Sans
    first, because fontconfig ranks DejaVuSans's PostScript name close to
    any "... Sans" request above every weak family. A scan rule cannot
    strip DejaVu's emoji, because NixOS pre-builds the font cache without
    user rules.
  - emoji resolves U+2615 to Twitter Color Emoji, the path apps that segment
    emoji-presentation characters take.
  - the resolved Twemoji file carries a CBDT or COLR table, read with
    fonttools. fontconfig's `color` property is true for the OpenType-SVG
    build too, which Chromium, Qt, and GTK draw in monochrome.
  - `fc-match -a emoji` lists Noto Color Emoji after Twitter Color Emoji.
    `-s` would trim Noto out, so `-a` is used.
  - for sans-serif, serif, and monospace, space, `1`, and `#` resolve to the
    same font as `A`, never to Twemoji. Twemoji covers those codepoints, so
    they catch Twemoji ordered ahead of a primary font, which `A` cannot.
  - sans-serif resolves `한` to the same font as `A`.

  It cannot see whether a running app draws the glyph in color;
  docs/verification.md carries that hardware step. Every failure is
  collected in one build.
