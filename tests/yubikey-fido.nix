    import ./tests/yubikey-fido.nix { inherit pkgs self; }

  Asserts that the YubiKey inventory tooling reaches every configuration
  `tests/lib/configurations.nix` yields as built output. The expectation is the
  same on every configuration, bootstrap outputs included: every host carries a
  YubiKey for recovery and signing. Every assertion below reads something
  activation produces -- the system path, the materialised udev rules
  directory, a rendered systemd unit, h82's Home Manager profile -- rather than
  the option lists those are derived from. An option list sits one level above
  the built system: environment.systemPackages can carry a package that
  pathsToLink or a collision keeps out of system.path, and
  services.udev.packages can carry a derivation whose rules never reach
  /etc/udev/rules.d.

  Verifies, on every configuration:
  - the system path carries bin/ykman.
  - h82's Home Manager profile carries bin/yubioath-flutter and the Yubico
    Authenticator desktop entry.
  - the materialised udev rules directory carries 69-yubikey.rules, which the
    yubikey-manager module contributes.
  - that same directory carries 60-fido-id.rules and 70-uaccess.rules. Those
    two, not the vendor rule, hand an inserted key to the seat's logged-in
    user, so they are the mechanism the no-manual-permission-step promise rests
    on. They come from systemd rather than from anything this repository
    declares, which is why asserting them is worth the lines: a conflicting
    rule, or a systemd change that drops either one, would otherwise stay
    invisible until someone met a permission error on real hardware.
  - the pcscd socket unit is rendered into the built system.

  The helper's guard runs first, so an empty configuration list fails the build
  instead of passing it. The builder collects every failure instead of exiting
  at the first, so one red build names every broken assertion across every
  configuration. That matters for the mutation rounds this repository
  requires: exiting early leaves all but the first assertion unobserved, and a
  round that produces no evidence for an assertion proves nothing about it.
