# Drives the helper against a stub podman that reports a machine's memory and

# machine changes nothing, a changed value stops the machine and sets it
# without starting it, a set that loses the race to the watchdog is retried,
# and one that always loses fails after the retry bound.

# how many sets fail before one succeeds, and `calls` collects each call.
