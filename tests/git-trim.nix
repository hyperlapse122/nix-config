  Check interface:

    import ./tests/git-trim.nix { inherit pkgs self; }

  Asserts that `git trim` only deletes local branches, and never rewrites a
  checkout's HEAD, for user `h82` on the ThinkPad and MS-7D91 production
  configurations. Bootstrap variants import the same Home Manager profile, so
  they add no coverage.

  Upstream git-trim defaults to `--delete merged:origin`, which also deletes
  merged branches on origin, and to detaching a checkout whose merged branch it
  deletes. The profile sets `merged-local` and `detach = false`, and this check
  proves both by running the packaged binary against a fixture rather than
  matching config text. Per host:

  - home.path carries bin/git-trim.
  - the rendered git/config does not turn off git-trim's deletion prompt.
  - with that config installed at $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config and git trim run
    from a linked worktree whose branch is merged, a merged tracking branch is
    deleted locally but survives on the bare origin, an unmerged tracking branch
    survives in both places, and the worktree keeps its branch checked out.

  git-trim reads trim.* through a vendored libgit2 that only finds global
  config at ~/.gitconfig and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config; it ignores
  GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL. The fixture therefore installs the file where Home Manager
  puts it on the hosts, and never passes --delete, which would bypass the
  config under test.

  Every lookup carries an `or` fallback so a mutation that removes a declaration
  reaches the builder as a failing assertion rather than an evaluation error.
  See
  .compound-engineering/artifacts/solutions/best-practices/unguarded-derivation-interpolation-defeats-nix-check-mutation-testing.md

  Each host runs in a subshell and records failures in a file, so one red build
  names every broken assertion across both hosts. A failed fixture step aborts
  the build under errexit instead.
