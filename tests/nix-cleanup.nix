    import ./tests/nix-cleanup.nix { inherit pkgs self; }

  Asserts that weekly Nix generation cleanup reaches every production
  configuration `tests/lib/configurations.nix` yields as built output, and
  reaches no bootstrap configuration at all. The expectation is taken from each
  configuration's `my.bootstrap`, never from the programs.nh options the module
  under test sets.

  Every assertion below reads something activation produces -- the rendered
  service and timer units, the materialised /etc/systemd/system tree, the system
  path -- rather than the programs.nh options they are derived from.  An option
  can evaluate correctly while a mkIf keeps the unit out of the built system, and
  a rendered unit exists even when nothing is wired to start it.

  Verifies, on every production configuration:
  - the nh-clean service unit exists, and the script its ExecStart names runs
    `nh clean all` with a retention count, a retention window, and --keep-one,
    without disabling store collection (--no-gc) or gcroot cleanup
    (--no-gcroots).
  - the nh-clean timer carries OnCalendar=weekly and Persistent=true, so a run
    missed while the machine was off is caught up at the next boot.
  - the materialised system unit tree wires that timer into timers.target.wants.
    Without this the two assertions above pass on a timer nothing ever starts.
  - the boot loader's configurationLimit is a number at all.  Both loader options
    are nullOr int and null is their default, meaning an unbounded menu that no
    finite retention count can cover.
  - the retention count is at or above the boot loader's configurationLimit.  The
    boot menu is rewritten only by a rebuild while collection runs on a timer, so
    a smaller count would leave menu entries naming collected generations.  The
    count is read out of the built start script rather than out of extraArgs, so
    the operand is the text the machine will actually run.
  - the system path ships bin/nh.  The nh module gates its package on
    programs.nh.enable and its units on clean.enable, so dropping the former
    leaves every assertion above untouched; this is the only one that sees it.
  - the system schedules no second collector.  nix-gc.service is materialised
    whenever Nix is enabled, so the signal is the absence of nix-gc.timer, not
    of the service.

  Verifies, on every bootstrap configuration:
  - the system renders neither unit and ships no bin/nh.

  The helper fails the check when it yields no configuration or no bootstrap
  output. The builder collects every failure instead of exiting at the first, so
  one red build names every broken assertion across every configuration.  That
  matters for the mutation rounds this repository requires: exiting early
  leaves the remaining assertions unobserved, and a round that produces no
  evidence for an assertion proves nothing about it.
