/*
  Shard set interface:

    import ./tests/check-shards.nix { inherit pkgs checks hostClosureChecks lightCount; }

  Splits the flake's checks into the shards CI builds, one job per shard,
  in the `check-shards` matrix of .github/workflows/check.yml. flake.nix
  exposes the result as `legacyPackages.x86_64-linux.checkShards`, so
  `nix build .#checkShards.<name>` builds one shard locally.

  - `hosts` holds `hostClosureChecks`: the checks whose closure carries a
    full NixOS system path or a Home Manager or system-manager generation.
    Each of them reads every host, so splitting them would make every shard
    that holds one fetch all the host closures again.
  - `light-1` through `light-<lightCount>` split the other checks by
    position in the sorted name list, modulo `lightCount`.

  Returns `{ members, shards }`. `members` maps each shard name to its check
  names and is plain data, so `check-shards-guard` reads it without forcing a
  check. `shards` maps each shard name to a linkFarm of its checks; building
  one builds every check it links.
