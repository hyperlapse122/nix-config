/*
  Check interface:

    import ./tests/check-shards-guard.nix { inherit pkgs checkNames members; }

  `checkNames` is the attribute names of the flake's checks, this guard
  included, and `members` is the shard membership from
  tests/check-shards.nix.

  Fails when a check is in no shard, so CI would never build it; when a
  check is in more than one shard; when a shard names something that is not
  a check; or when a shard is empty, or there is no shard at all. CI builds
  the checks only through the shards, so a gap here is a check that silently
  stops running.

  Only names reach the builder, never a check derivation, so building the
  guard builds no other check. Every problem is listed before it fails.
