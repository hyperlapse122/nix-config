# Drives the device helper against a stub xcrun and a stub avdmanager. It
# downloads the newest iOS runtime only when it is missing, creates only the
# declared devices whose versioned names do not exist yet, keeps devices of an
# older version, a hand-made device, and an undeclared one, skips a platform
# whose tool is missing with one message, reports a device it cannot create or
# a platform step that stops early, and always exits 0. avdmanager runs only
# with the JDK --java-home names. No scenario may delete, erase, rename, or
# move anything.
