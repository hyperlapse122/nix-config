  Asserts that Claude Code's declared settings reach user `h82` through the
  right tier on every Home Manager user environment
  `tests/lib/configurations.nix` yields (`userEntries`): NixOS and non-NixOS
  hosts, production and bootstrap alike, since no tier depends on a host kind,
  a host trait, or `my.bootstrap`.

  The declared set is split across three tiers. A setting whose persistent
  form is an environment variable is declared through session variables; a key
  Claude Code reads only from its global config is written into ~/.claude.json
  at activation; everything else is written into ~/.claude/settings.json at
  activation. Claude Code rewrites both files itself, so a read-only store
  symlink cannot live at either. The managed settings tier is deliberately
  unused: it blocks a change even inside a running session. A plugin is
  enabled through one leaf of settings.json's enabledPlugins object, declared
  as a nested path so the merge leaves every other plugin's entry alone.

  Verifies, per configuration:
  - every environment-tier variable carries its declared value.
  - for each merge -- home.activation.claudeSettings into
    ~/.claude/settings.json and home.activation.claudeGlobalConfig into
    ~/.claude.json -- the activation exists, runs after installPackages,
    invokes the packaged merger on that file, and does not swallow the merger's
    exit status, so a symlinked or malformed file fails the rebuild instead of
    passing silently.
  - the JSON this repository renders for each merge carries every declared key
    and nested path at its declared value and lists every retired key for
    removal. Asserting the rendered file rather than the Nix attribute set
    keeps the check on what activation actually feeds the merger.
  - no environment.etc entry declares claude-code/managed-settings.json, on
    each NixOS configuration (`entries`), the only kind with environment.etc.
  - no Home Manager file targets either merged file. An activation-time
    merge and a store symlink are mutually exclusive, so this assertion now
    guards the mechanism rather than contradicting it. Home Manager resolves a
    file's destination from `target`, which only defaults to the attribute
    name, so the lookup compares resolved targets rather than attribute names.

  Whether the merge preserves undeclared keys is not assertable from evaluated
  configuration at all -- it is behaviour of the packaged script. The
  `agent-settings` check in flake.nix runs that script against a seeded,
  divergent settings file instead.

  Every lookup carries an `or` fallback so a mutation that removes an entry or
  a key reaches the builder as shell rather than failing evaluation on a null
  interpolation. See
  .compound-engineering/artifacts/solutions/best-practices/unguarded-derivation-interpolation-defeats-nix-check-mutation-testing.md

  The builder collects every failure instead of exiting at the first, so one
  red build names every broken assertion across every configuration.
