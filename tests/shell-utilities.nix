/*
  Check interface:

    import ./tests/shell-utilities.nix { inherit pkgs self; }

  Asserts that the shell-scripting utilities reach user `h82` on every
  configuration `tests/lib/configurations.nix` yields, bootstrap outputs
  included, so a change that gates the profile on `my.bootstrap` fails here.

  The expected executables are listed here rather than read from
  home/h82/shell/utilities.nix, so removing a package from the module fails
  the check. Each one runs from home.path against a fixed input and its
  output is compared, because an existence test alone passes for a binary
  that exists but does not work.

  Every lookup carries an `or` fallback so a mutation that removes a declaration
  reaches the builder as a failing assertion rather than an evaluation error.
  See
  .compound-engineering/artifacts/solutions/best-practices/unguarded-derivation-interpolation-defeats-nix-check-mutation-testing.md

  Each configuration runs in a subshell and records failures in a file, so one
  red build names every broken assertion across every configuration. The
  helper's guard runs first, so an empty configuration list fails the build
  instead of passing it.
