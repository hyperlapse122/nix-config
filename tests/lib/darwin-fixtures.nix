  Helper interface:

    darwinFixtures = import ./lib/darwin-fixtures.nix { inherit inputs; };

  The macOS fixture hosts under tests/fixtures/hosts/, assembled through the
  same lib/darwin-host.nix the flake uses for real hosts. They stand in for
  the Mac that has not been bought, which would need card-encrypted material
  under secrets/.

  Returns one `{ name, fixture, bootstrap, host }` per fixture and variant,
  where `name` is the output name (`<fixture>` or `<fixture>-bootstrap`),
  `fixture` the directory name, and `host` the darwinSystem. Fixture names are
  read from the directory, never written out, so host-name-guard can keep
  them out of code.
