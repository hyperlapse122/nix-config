  The Compound Engineering review tokens a user environment must allow,
  sorted, derived from the `pname`s of its installed `packages` rather than
  from my.agents.crossModelPeers, so a module that installs a peer harness
  but drops its token fails. OpenCode maps to the opencode token. Antigravity
  has no entry, so it stays out of CROSS_MODEL_PEERS even where
  antigravity-acp-path is installed.
