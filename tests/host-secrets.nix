    import ./tests/host-secrets.nix { inherit pkgs; }

  Runs the packaged scripts/host-secrets against a scratch HOME and the fake
  secrets from tests/lib/fake-secrets.nix, in the order Home Manager
  activation runs it on a non-NixOS host:

  - without an identity, `stage` fails, names the identity path and the
    recovery command, and leaves nothing staged or published;
  - with an identity that is not a recipient, `stage` fails the same way and
    prints no token;
  - an identity with the wrong mode or a symlinked identity is refused;
  - an SSH file the identity cannot decrypt, a token publish-cli-auth
    rejects, or an SSH field that is no private key fails stage and leaves no
    plaintext behind;
  - with the right identity, `stage` then `publish` leave gh and glab
    configuration at 0600, the tokens at 0400 in ~/.local/state/cli-auth, and
    the SSH key at 0600 matching the encrypted one, with no staging left;
  - a second run over the published state succeeds with the same result;
  - `publish` refuses to write the SSH key through a symlink.
