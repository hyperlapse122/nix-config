  Check interface:

    import ./tests/iphone-restore.nix { inherit pkgs self; }

  Asserts what modules/nixos/hardware/iphone-restore.nix produces on every
  configuration `tests/lib/configurations.nix` yields. The DFU and
  recovery-mode `uaccess` rule and its file order are asserted by
  `tests/udev-device-access.nix`; this check covers the rest of the restore
  path. Every assertion reads something activation produces -- the
  materialised systemd unit tree, the materialised udev rules directory, the
  system path -- never `services.usbmuxd.enable` or the package list.

  On every configuration:
  - the materialised unit tree carries a usbmuxd.service that runs usbmuxd
    as the usbmux user, so a unit masked to /dev/null fails, and
    multi-user.target wants it. idevicerestore reaches a device in restore
    mode only through usbmuxd.
  - some file in the materialised udev rules directory carries the usbmuxd
    module's rule giving Apple USB devices to the usbmux group, verbatim.
  - the system path ships executable bin/idevicerestore, bin/irecovery, and
    bin/ideviceinfo.

  It cannot see whether a real device enters DFU mode or restores;
  docs/verification.md covers that on hardware.

  Every /etc lookup carries an `or null` fallback and store paths are
  interpolated only inside the present branch, so a missing entry fails inside
  the builder rather than during evaluation. The builder collects every failure
  instead of exiting at the first, so one red build names every affected
  configuration.
