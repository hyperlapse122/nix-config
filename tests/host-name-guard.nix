/*
  Check interface:

    import ./tests/host-name-guard.nix { inherit pkgs self; }

  Fails when a host name appears in the repository's code: `flake.nix`,
  `modules/`, `home/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `packages/`, and
  `.github/workflows/`. Host names come from the directories under `hosts/`,
  so the list is never written out here. `hosts/`, `secrets/`, `docs/`, and
  the top-level prose files are not scanned.

  The search is a case-insensitive fixed-string match on the full host name,
  so prose such as "the ThinkPad's" stays legal. The builder lists every
  `file:line` hit before it fails, and it also fails when no host is
  discovered or a scanned path is missing, so it never passes vacuously.
