  Check interface:

    import ./tests/linux-host-secrets.nix { inherit pkgs self; }

  Runs tests/linux-host-secrets.sh over the repository, then over fixture
  trees built here with fake keys, so each rule it enforces is proven to fail
  when broken even while hosts/ holds no non-NixOS host. Every tree encrypts
  its secret files to the recipients its .sops.yaml rules name, except where a
  mutation makes the two disagree:

  - a well-formed tree passes;
  - a host SSH file encrypted to a second recipient fails;
  - a missing host SSH file, or a missing recorded recipient, fails;
  - a host recipient missing from the tokens.yaml rule fails;
  - a tokens.yaml rule that names the host while the file was never re-keyed
    for it fails;
  - a host recipient in the wifi.yaml or tailscale.yaml rule fails;
  - a wifi.yaml encrypted to the host while its rule does not name it fails.
